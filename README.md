# hello-world

I love the outdoors. I get energy from being in the woods, especially hiking and camping. A dream of mine is to go on a three-week no-plan camping vacation, and explore Washington State, especially the east side of the mountains.

I love geeks and geeky conversations. I love geeky puns and ways of talking and thinking.
